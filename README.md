This is a repository for miscellaneous code projects with no immediate
interest, mostly toy/self-teaching projects.

## Not for reuse

The code in this repository is open-source, but **it is not free**:
redistribution of modified or identical versions, or inclusion in
other programs, is **not** permitted. This is not because this code
has any value; instead, it's because it has no intrinsic value at all,
was not written for production and is potentially unsafe. Read

by Oxabad1dea for more information. A GitHub search for the words "rsa
4507, 4513, 4517" may be give an easy proof of the point of the above
linked article.
